Final Project for LHL

## Title
Sentiment Analysis for Consumer Products based on NLP

## Goals/Outcomes
To assess the sentiment of a consumerâ€™s experience with a product based on interview-style feedback

## Description
As the consumer landscape evolves, companies are attempting to better understand their customer, their needs, their wants, and their experience with the product. Data science can help companies by using NLP (natural language processing) to gain insights into feedback provided with language (as opposed to numerical assessments) and insights into the consumer psychology. These insights are one tool which can help companies tailor their products to achieve their desired business goals and continuously improve their products.
