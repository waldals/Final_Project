Final Project for LHL

## Title
Sentiment Analysis for Consumer Products based on NLP

## Goals/Outcomes
To assess the sentiment of a consumerâ€™s experience with a product based on interview-style feedback

## Description
As the consumer landscape evolves, companies are attempting to better understand their customer, their needs, their wants, and their experience with the product. Data science can help companies by using NLP (natural language processing) to gain insights into feedback provided with language (as opposed to numerical assessments) and insights into the consumer psychology. These insights are one tool which can help companies tailor their products to achieve their desired business goals and continuously improve their products. 
 
NLP has advanced significantly since 2018 to assess customer feedback and sentiment towards consumer goods. BERT is a state-of-the-art model that has been developed to obtain insights on this type of data and base models are available to be used as a starting point for new data sets. 

This project will use BERT with customer feedback. The outcome of the model will be able to assess the sentiment of the feedback. From this, insights into business areas of focus can be obtained.
